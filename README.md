- **Description**: Part 7 explores SQL functions' power to return tables or specific values and delves into dynamic SQL concepts. It introduces COALESCE for handling NULL values effectively and demonstrates TRY_CAST's safe data type conversion. Additionally, it covers CROSS APPLY, enabling the combination of rows from multiple tables. These exercises deepen understanding of functions' versatility, NULL value management, safe type conversions, and advanced querying techniques like CROSS APPLY.

- **Main Knowledge**: ***FUNCTIONS Return Tables/Values, Dynamic SQL, COALESCE, TRY_CAST, CROSS APPLY***

##### Part 8 - The Art of SQL Logic: Looping Techniques and Conditional Structures *(Query 351 to 400)*
- **URL**: [Part 8 - The Art of SQL Logic: Looping Techniques and Conditional Structures](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-sql-projects/blob/main/AW-Project-Part-8.sql)
- **Description**: While loops and basic logics were barely mentioned in the previous parts, part 9 is dedicated to helping learners grasp logic and develop a problem-solving mindset about loops and conditions. This section shows all the knowledge required to understand the concepts of WHILE and IF, but it does so with a smaller focus on tables and data than the previous sections. Despite the fact that many challenges were developed uniquely and that task requirements may have been similar, solving them required a great deal of critical thinking. Furthermore, the BIT, also known as "Booleans" in other programming languages, which are either 1 (True) or 0 (False), also caused some of the very first problems with this section. In combination with the complex use of Subqueries and 'WHERE EXISTS,' this section enhances the problem solving mechanism.
